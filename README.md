# MeetingManagementServer

The goal of the Web API is to provide meeting dates with maximal attendance for every partners' country. Partners and their availability should be specified beforehand via REST API. Currently, every meeting is assumed to take 2 consecutive days.

Implemented using ASP.NET Core.

* [REST API for specifying and manging partners](PartnersRestApi.md)
* [API for building meeting dates](MeetingApi.md)
